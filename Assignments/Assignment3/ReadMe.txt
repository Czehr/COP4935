To build and run the assignment programs, simply run the following commands in a terminal with make and g++ installed:

To build the executables:
make

To run the program:
./LFTT.out


The number of threads, number of operations, operation distributions, transaction sizes, etc. can be manipulated through the source code, as they have been implemented using global constants.



Approach, efficiency, and correctness:

The nonblocking list is very similar to our blocking list, except that it does not use locks. Instead, it utilizes atomic instructions. The idea behind this implementation is to use an atomic markable reference. This reference stores both a pointer and an address in a single atomic value. Each node uses one of these types of pointers to point to the next node. If the reference bit in the node's pointer is true, then the node's successor is logically deleted. Otherwise it's logically inserted. We can linearize removals when the logical removal occurs and have all threads share the work of the physical deletion later if needed. We benefit from making each node's pointer atomic because we can linearize when a pointer change occurs. For instance, an insertion linearizes upon success when the new node's predecessorâ€™s pointer changes to point to the new node.

The transactional component was added based on the LFTT paper, and maintains the correctness guarantees defined there. In short, if a thread's transaction is invalidated at any point, it will help complete the other transaction that blocked it before trying again. This ensures lock freedom, because some thread will always make progress.
