How are the following represented in the AST: function declaration, function definition, and function call? Include descriptions of any necessary symbols including those which might represent parameters and arguments.

Function declaration:	SgFunctionDeclaration
	Function parameters:	SgFunctionParameterList
Function definition:	SgFunctionDefinition
Function call:				SgFunctionCallExp
	Note that a function call is assembled from a function expression and arguments. The two are bound together in a function call, function expressions are never called directly (the function call argument list can be empty). 


How do the representations of these AST nodes differ for generateDOT() vs generateAstGraph()?

generateDOT() is a function built into ROSE. It creates a DOT file, a graphical format, which is used to visualize ASTs via nodes and edge connections. 
generateAstGraph() is a similar function, except it is much more detailed in its representation of the input code. generateAstGraph() depicts additional attributes for each node, such as types and mnodifiers.
